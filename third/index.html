        <div class="leftText">I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
          Hello. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? No.
          That's Strickland. Didn't that guy ever have hair?<br><br>

          I followed you. Leave me alone. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet
          proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you.
          About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time
          continuum. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Don't
          worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at
          precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the
          tower, everything will be fine.<br><br>

          Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. whoa, whoa Doc,
          stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.
          Who's are these? Oh. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?<br><br>

          Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to
          get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my
          reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that
          to happen would you? Would you? Maybe you were adopted. Hot dog, Doc.
          Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Are you
          gonna order something, kid? Hey.<br><br>

          Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time
          machine works. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me
          that it's 8:25? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I
          could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me
          around. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Oh, pleased
          to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?<br><br>

          laboratory, we've gotta get you home. She's just trying to keep you
          respectable. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight
          and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Your not gonna
          be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue,
          right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna

          Nothing. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Doc, wait.
          No, morons. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Hey wait,
          wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these darn kids
